# ThebombzenAPI #

ThebombzenAPI prerequisite for Thebombzen's mods

See [http://is.gd/ThebombzensMods#ThebombzenAPI](http://is.gd/ThebombzensMods#ThebombzenAPI) for details.

## Compiling ##

Clone the repository, and then navigate to ThebombzenAPI and run:

	$ ./build.sh

This will create the directory "build" which and all build supplies inside of it, and should create a finished ThebombzenAPI jar file upon completion.

On Windows? Sorry, you're on your own. I don't know how to write CMD Batch files. 

## Eclipse ##

Once you've run the buildscript at least once, you can go to Eclipse and select File -> Import -> Existing Projects to Workspace, and select ThebombzenAPI as the root project directory. If you have the Git plugin it should recognize ThebombzenAPI as a git respository.
